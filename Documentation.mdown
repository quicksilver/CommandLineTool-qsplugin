The `qs` command allows you to select files or text in Quicksilver (or send them to the Shelf) from the command line.

Select a file:

    qs MyFile.jpg
    qs ~/Documents

Select multiple files:

    qs file1.txt file2.txt
    qs *.pdf

Select text:

    echo example | qs
    echo "example with multiple words" | qs
    whoami | qs
    pbpaste | qs

Note that when you pipe text to `qs`, the same smarts apply that you would get when typing text by hand. URLs, file paths, etc. are automatically recognized and the appropriate action will be displayed in Quicksilver's interface.

To send an item to the Shelf instead of selecting it, use the `-s` option.

    qs -s ~/Documents/MyMainProject
